# Data Journalism Project 

This project investigates occupational trends and wages in Canada, focusing on an exploratory data analysis to dive into the statistics of the data and then utilizing Generative AI to interpret the findings. This project was developed by Lonely Octopus, which is an 8 week AI and Data Science bootcamp (more info [here](https://www.lonelyoctopus.com/)!).
